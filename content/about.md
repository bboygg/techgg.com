Hey thereðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Sungjo-Go, but my friends call me George Go or GG, a dedicated Software Quality Engineer from Seoul, South Korea. </br>

I specialize in QA Methodology, efficient Software Testing (both manual and automated), and have a interest in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

With over three years in the industry, I bring proficiency in Software Testing, Java and SQL, and am currently enhancing my skills by learning Python through the [cs50p course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). My aim is to ensure the delivery of high-quality software solutions that meet the highest standards.

In addition to my tech pursuits, I'm an enthusiastic break-dancer and maintain a blog, [breakinafterwork.com](https://breakinafterwork.com). Here, I share insights and experiences for dancers who, like me, juggle their passion for dance with a full-time career.

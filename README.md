## How to Run Local Server 
#### 1. Initialize the Main Project
Since I'm using the theme in the submodule, I need to initialize the main project and submodules.
Run the following command at project directory.
```
git submodule init 
git submoudle update
```

#### 2. Initialize the Theme Submodule
Run the following command at submodule dicrectory (where theme is located.)
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

#### 3. Start Hugo Server
Run the following command at main project directory.
```
hugo server -D
// The -D flag includes content marked as draft, which can be useful during development.
```

It will be like 
```
 ~/bboygg/techgg.com hugo server -D
